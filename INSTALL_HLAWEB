Installing the routines on hladev (once Niall or Lee has already
built cfitsio).

Note that it is necessary to build these programs on hladev1 because
hladev2 does not have the necessary jpg and png libraries.  On the
other hand, the gdb program exists only on hladev2 for some reason,
so if you need to do debugging then you should run it there.

First build and install libwcs (in the libwcs/ directory):

make
install -d /hladev/hladocs/hla/include/libwcs
install *.h /hladev/hladocs/hla/include/libwcs
install libwcs.a /hladev/hladocs/hla/lib

Configure and install fitscut:

setenv CFLAGS "-I/hladev/hladocs/hla/include"
setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/hladev/hladocs/hla/include"
setenv LDFLAGS "-L/hladev/hladocs/hla/lib"
./configure --prefix=/hladev/hladocs/hla
make
make install

This ought to install fitscut in the /usr/local/hla/bin directory...

Optimized version:

setenv CFLAGS "-O3 -I/hladev/hladocs/hla/include"
setenv CPPFLAGS "-O3 -I/hladev/hladocs/hla/include"
setenv LDFLAGS "-O3 -L/hladev/hladocs/hla/lib"
./configure --prefix=/hladev/hladocs/hla
make
make install

Debug version: (NOT INSTALLED)

setenv CFLAGS "-g -I/hladev/hladocs/hla/include"
setenv CPPFLAGS "-g -I/hladev/hladocs/hla/include"
setenv LDFLAGS "-g -L/hladev/hladocs/hla/lib"
./configure --prefix=/hladev/hladocs/hla
/bin/rm *.o
make
mv fitscut fitscut.debug
/bin/rm *.o

THEN REBUILD THE NORMAL VERSION (OPTIMIZED OR NOT)
