To install using the routines under Solaris (working on archdev at
the moment), do this:

setenv CFLAGS "-I/usr/local/gnome-1.4/include -I/usr/local/include"
setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/gnome-1.4/include -I/usr/local/include"
setenv LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/gnome-1.4/lib -L/usr/local/lib"
./configure --prefix=/home/rlw
make install

This ought to install fitscut in the /home/rlw/bin directory...

I'm omitting the wcstools libraries at the moment.  They are supposed to
be optional and I didn't find them in a quick search.

# setenv CFLAGS "-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/wcstools"
# setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/wcstools"
# setenv LDFLAGS "-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/wcstools/libwcs"

I have not figured out where these libraries might be on stdatu.  This
works on archdev.
